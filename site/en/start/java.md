## How to build ?

### Set up the workspace

* | BEFORE build the project
  * REQUIRED
  * ðŸ‘€create `MODULE.bazel` ðŸ‘€
* | build the project -- by -- Bazel,
  * ALL inputs & dependencies MUST be | SAME workspace 
    * Reason: ðŸ§  files / place | DIFFERENT workspaces -> independent ðŸ§ 
    * if you want to use OTHER workspace's dependencies -> link it

### Understand the BUILD file

* TODO:
A `BUILD` file contains several different types of instructions for Bazel.
The most important type is the *build rule*, which tells Bazel how to build the
desired outputs, such as executable binaries or libraries. Each instance
of a build rule in the `BUILD` file is called a *target* and points to a
specific set of source files and dependencies. A target can also point to other
targets.

Take a look at the `java-tutorial/BUILD` file:

```python
java_binary(
    name = "ProjectRunner",
    srcs = glob(["src/main/java/com/example/*.java"]),
)
```

In our example, the `ProjectRunner` target instantiates Bazel's built-in
[`java_binary` rule](/reference/be/java#java_binary). The rule tells Bazel to
build a `.jar` file and a wrapper shell script (both named after the target).

The attributes in the target explicitly state its dependencies and options.
While the `name` attribute is mandatory, many are optional. For example, in the
`ProjectRunner` rule target, `name` is the name of the target, `srcs` specifies
the source files that Bazel uses to build the target, and `main_class` specifies
the class that contains the main method. (You may have noticed that our example
uses [glob](/reference/be/functions#glob) to pass a set of source files to Bazel
instead of listing them one by one.)

### Build the project

To build your sample project, navigate to the `java-tutorial` directory
and run:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //:ProjectRunner
```
In the target label, the `//` part is the location of the `BUILD` file
relative to the root of the workspace (in this case, the root itself),
and `ProjectRunner` is the target name in the `BUILD` file. (You will
learn about target labels in more detail at the end of this tutorial.)

Bazel produces output similar to the following:

```bash
   INFO: Found 1 target...
   Target //:ProjectRunner up-to-date:
      bazel-bin/ProjectRunner.jar
      bazel-bin/ProjectRunner
   INFO: Elapsed time: 1.021s, Critical Path: 0.83s
```

Congratulations, you just built your first Bazel target! Bazel places build
outputs in the `bazel-bin` directory at the root of the workspace. Browse
through its contents to get an idea for Bazel's output structure.

Now test your freshly built binary:

```posix-terminal
bazel-bin/ProjectRunner
```

### Review the dependency graph

Bazel requires build dependencies to be explicitly declared in BUILD files.
Bazel uses those statements to create the project's dependency graph, which
enables accurate incremental builds.

To visualize the sample project's dependencies, you can generate a text
representation of the dependency graph by running this command at the
workspace root:

```posix-terminal
bazel query  --notool_deps --noimplicit_deps "deps(//:ProjectRunner)" --output graph
```

The above command tells Bazel to look for all dependencies for the target
`//:ProjectRunner` (excluding host and implicit dependencies) and format the
output as a graph.

Then, paste the text into [GraphViz](http://www.webgraphviz.com/).

As you can see, the project has a single target that build two source files with
no additional dependencies:

![Dependency graph of the target 'ProjectRunner'](/docs/images/tutorial_java_01.svg)

After you set up your workspace, build your project, and examine its
dependencies, then you can add some complexity.

## Refine your Bazel build

While a single target is sufficient for small projects, you may want to split
larger projects into multiple targets and packages to allow for fast incremental
builds (that is, only rebuild what's changed) and to speed up your builds by
building multiple parts of a project at once.

### Specify multiple build targets

You can split the sample project build into two targets. Replace the contents of
the `java-tutorial/BUILD` file with the following:

```python
java_binary(
    name = "ProjectRunner",
    srcs = ["src/main/java/com/example/ProjectRunner.java"],
    main_class = "com.example.ProjectRunner",
    deps = [":greeter"],
)

java_library(
    name = "greeter",
    srcs = ["src/main/java/com/example/Greeting.java"],
)
```

With this configuration, Bazel first builds the `greeter` library, then the
`ProjectRunner` binary. The `deps` attribute in `java_binary` tells Bazel that
the `greeter` library is required to build the `ProjectRunner` binary.

To build this new version of the project, run the following command:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //:ProjectRunner
```

Bazel produces output similar to the following:

```
INFO: Found 1 target...
Target //:ProjectRunner up-to-date:
  bazel-bin/ProjectRunner.jar
  bazel-bin/ProjectRunner
INFO: Elapsed time: 2.454s, Critical Path: 1.58s
```

Now test your freshly built binary:

```posix-terminal
bazel-bin/ProjectRunner
```

If you now modify `ProjectRunner.java` and rebuild the project, Bazel only
recompiles that file.

Looking at the dependency graph, you can see that `ProjectRunner` depends on the
same inputs as it did before, but the structure of the build is different:

![Dependency graph of the target 'ProjectRunner' after adding a dependency](
/docs/images/tutorial_java_02.svg)

You've now built the project with two targets. The `ProjectRunner` target builds
one source files and depends on one other target (`:greeter`), which builds
one additional source file.

### Use multiple packages

Letâ€™s now split the project into multiple packages. If you take a look at the
`src/main/java/com/example/cmdline` directory, you can see that it also contains
a `BUILD` file, plus some source files. Therefore, to Bazel, the workspace now
contains two packages, `//src/main/java/com/example/cmdline` and `//` (since
there is a `BUILD` file at the root of the workspace).

Take a look at the `src/main/java/com/example/cmdline/BUILD` file:

```python
java_binary(
    name = "runner",
    srcs = ["Runner.java"],
    main_class = "com.example.cmdline.Runner",
    deps = ["//:greeter"],
)
```

The `runner` target depends on the `greeter` target in the `//` package (hence
the target label `//:greeter`) - Bazel knows this through the `deps` attribute.
Take a look at the dependency graph:

![Dependency graph of the target 'runner'](/docs/images/tutorial_java_03.svg)

However, for the build to succeed, you must explicitly give the `runner` target
in `//src/main/java/com/example/cmdline/BUILD` visibility to targets in
`//BUILD` using the `visibility` attribute. This is because by default targets
are only visible to other targets in the same `BUILD` file. (Bazel uses target
visibility to prevent issues such as libraries containing implementation details
leaking into public APIs.)

To do this, add the `visibility` attribute to the `greeter` target in
`java-tutorial/BUILD` as shown below:

```python
java_library(
    name = "greeter",
    srcs = ["src/main/java/com/example/Greeting.java"],
    visibility = ["//src/main/java/com/example/cmdline:__pkg__"],
)
```

Now you can build the new package by running the following command at the root
of the workspace:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //src/main/java/com/example/cmdline:runner
```

Bazel produces output similar to the following:

```
INFO: Found 1 target...
Target //src/main/java/com/example/cmdline:runner up-to-date:
  bazel-bin/src/main/java/com/example/cmdline/runner.jar
  bazel-bin/src/main/java/com/example/cmdline/runner
  INFO: Elapsed time: 1.576s, Critical Path: 0.81s
```

Now test your freshly built binary:

```posix-terminal
./bazel-bin/src/main/java/com/example/cmdline/runner
```

You've now modified the project to build as two packages, each containing one
target, and understand the dependencies between them.


## Use labels to reference targets

In `BUILD` files and at the command line, Bazel uses target labels to reference
targets - for example, `//:ProjectRunner` or
`//src/main/java/com/example/cmdline:runner`. Their syntax is as follows:

```
//path/to/package:target-name
```

If the target is a rule target, then `path/to/package` is the path to the
directory containing the `BUILD` file, and `target-name` is what you named the
target in the `BUILD` file (the `name` attribute). If the target is a file
target, then `path/to/package` is the path to the root of the package, and
`target-name` is the name of the target file, including its full path.

When referencing targets at the repository root, the package path is empty,
just use `//:target-name`. When referencing targets within the same `BUILD`
file, you can even skip the `//` workspace root identifier and just use
`:target-name`.

For example, for targets in the `java-tutorial/BUILD` file, you did not have to
specify a package path, since the workspace root is itself a package (`//`), and
your two target labels were simply `//:ProjectRunner` and `//:greeter`.

However, for targets in the `//src/main/java/com/example/cmdline/BUILD` file you
had to specify the full package path of `//src/main/java/com/example/cmdline`
and your target label was `//src/main/java/com/example/cmdline:runner`.

## Package a Java target for deployment

Letâ€™s now package a Java target for deployment by building the binary with all
of its runtime dependencies. This lets you run the binary outside of your
development environment.

As you remember, the [java_binary](/reference/be/java#java_binary) build rule
produces a `.jar` and a wrapper shell script. Take a look at the contents of
`runner.jar` using this command:

```posix-terminal
jar tf bazel-bin/src/main/java/com/example/cmdline/runner.jar
```

The contents are:

```
META-INF/
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
com/
com/example/
com/example/cmdline/
com/example/cmdline/Runner.class
```
As you can see, `runner.jar` contains `Runner.class`, but not its dependency,
`Greeting.class`. The `runner` script that Bazel generates adds `greeter.jar`
to the classpath, so if you leave it like this, it will run locally, but it
won't run standalone on another machine. Fortunately, the `java_binary` rule
allows you to build a self-contained, deployable binary. To build it, append
`_deploy.jar` to the target name:

```posix-terminal
bazel build //src/main/java/com/example/cmdline:runner_deploy.jar
```

Bazel produces output similar to the following:

```
INFO: Found 1 target...
Target //src/main/java/com/example/cmdline:runner_deploy.jar up-to-date:
  bazel-bin/src/main/java/com/example/cmdline/runner_deploy.jar
INFO: Elapsed time: 1.700s, Critical Path: 0.23s
```
You have just built `runner_deploy.jar`, which you can run standalone away from
your development environment since it contains the required runtime
dependencies. Take a look at the contents of this standalone JAR using the
same command as before:

```posix-terminal
jar tf bazel-bin/src/main/java/com/example/cmdline/runner_deploy.jar
```

The contents include all of the necessary classes to run:

```
META-INF/
META-INF/MANIFEST.MF
build-data.properties
com/
com/example/
com/example/cmdline/
com/example/cmdline/Runner.class
com/example/Greeting.class
```
